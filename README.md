# Three Bugs
Gosh darn it, our code for our STI solver has three bugs!

Code has been added for you to write the information to the DOM. Read each line and think conceptually about what
the code is 'telling' you.

Make sure to reference the original challenge for the specific notes on what the application is supposed to do.

Once you have a handle on that, notice that the result of the code is... well... not right.
It seems that our information is not being displayed correctly.

Walk through the code and see if you can spot what is going wrong. 
Additionally, try using console.logs strategically to see if you can isolate the issues.
Once you have found an issue, go ahead and make the correction.

At the top of the document, add comments about the errors that you have found.
Make sure to severe the connection to this remote repo and check your work into your own remote repo!

Good luck!

## Hard Mode
Correct the output to the DOM so that it includes spaces between each set of information, rather than be bundled 
close as it is now.

Example, "information,information,information" > "information, information, information"

## Pro Mode
Style the result to be 'prettier'! Part of making it prettier means that you will want to remove the bullets from 
the list items. However, in this mode, you are not allowed to change it from 'li' items as it is now.

## Pro Extended
Install the [Bootstrap Library](http://getbootstrap.com/). Read the documentation and determine how to apply Bootstrap classes to style your page. Use at least 4 Bootstrap-specific classes.
